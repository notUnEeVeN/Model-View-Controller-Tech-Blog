## Description

This is the 14th Module project for the 14th week of the UCB Coding bootcamp, this week we used a culmination of all the skills we've learned of sql database management and routing, password authenticators and hashers, and etc. to create a Tech Blog website where people can create an account to create, edit, or delete their own posts, or leave comments under other's posts.
